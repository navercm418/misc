Troubleshooting InterSystems Caché Error
Background
A Caché error <subscript>BLDTABS+10^STMNLBAT^STTABLES("") was encountered. This document outlines the steps taken to identify and resolve the issue.

Steps to Examine the Variables and Code Line
Initial Error Encounter

We first encountered the error while running the code:

mumps
S ^LBNTMP($J,"TABLES",TABLE)=$P(^STTABLES(TABLE),"^",1)
Debugging the Code

We added debugging output to check the values of the TABLE variable and the corresponding entry in ^STTABLES.

mumps
WRITE !,"TABLE: ", TABLE
WRITE !,"^STTABLES(TABLE): ", $GET(^STTABLES(TABLE))
Verification of TABLE Variable

We ensured that the TABLE variable had a valid value and corresponded to an entry in the ^STTABLES global.

Inspection of ^STTABLES Entries

We used the command ZWRITE ^STTABLES to inspect the entries in the ^STTABLES global and confirmed that some entries were missing.

Tracking Down the Missing Field
We identified that the error was caused by missing entries in the ^STTABLES global. The TABLE variable corresponded to the field LTTABLE in the STLETTER or Letter Definition table, which was missing certain entries.

Troubleshooting Steps for the Future
Validate Entries

Ensure that the TABLE variable has a valid corresponding entry in ^STTABLES. Use the following check:

mumps
IF $DATA(^STTABLES(TABLE))=0 DO  QUIT
. WRITE "Error: TABLE definition missing in ^STTABLES: ", TABLE,!
Initialize Missing Entries

Initialize any missing entries in ^STTABLES to prevent errors:

mumps
SET ^STTABLES(TABLE)=$GET(^STTABLES(TABLE), "default value")
Implement Error Handling

Add error handling to catch missing definitions and log or report them:

mumps
IF '$DATA(^STTABLES(TABLE)) DO
. WRITE "Missing TABLE in ^STTABLES: ", TABLE,!
Summary
During troubleshooting, we identified that the Caché error was due to missing entries in the ^STTABLES global. By validating the TABLE variable and inspecting the ^STTABLES entries, we pinpointed the missing field TABLE that corresponded to the LTTABLE field in the STLETTER table. Implementing checks, initialization, and error handling can prevent such issues in the future.
